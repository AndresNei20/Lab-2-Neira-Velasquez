**What is this lab about?**

We must to do a fecth to the pokemon API, specifically of the pokemon starters of generation 1. Then, when the users clicks a starter, some data will appear and the possibility of evolving it and returning it, making a second API call, requesting the new information

The lab was developed in Vanilla JavaScript
